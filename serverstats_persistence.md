# Server Statistics Persistence Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the enhanced serverstats system that now persists across bot restarts. The implementation ensures that message counts and other statistics are accurately maintained even when the bot goes offline and comes back online.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modified `/serverstats` Command
- Now uses `message_log` table for counting messages instead of `server_stats`
- Message logs contain timestamps that allow for accurate date filtering
- Calculates total messages, reactions, and user activity correctly
- Shows the most recent update time based on message logs

### 2. Enhanced `/resetstats` Command
- Now deletes both message logs and server stats for the current day
- Uses date range filtering to maintain data from other days
- Provides more detailed information in the success message

### 3. Data Structure
The implementation relies on these key tables:
- `message_log`: Stores individual message records with timestamps
- `server_stats`: Still used for reaction counts and other aggregate data
- `users`: Used to count registered users

## How It Works

1. When a user sends a message, it's logged in the `message_log` table with:
   - User ID
   - Channel ID
   - Timestamp

2. When the `/serverstats` command is used:
   - Counts today's messages from `message_log` filtered by date
   - Calculates all-time statistics from the entire message history
   - Identifies the most active hours based on message timestamps
   - Shows when the most recent message was logged

3. When `/resetstats` is used:
   - Deletes message logs for the current day only
   - Resets server_stats for the current day
   - Maintains historical data

## Testing
A test script `test_serverstats.py` is included to verify the functionality:
- It adds sample message data for today and yesterday
- Verifies that message counts work correctly across different time periods
- Confirms that hourly statistics are calculated properly

## Benefits
- Statistics remain accurate even if the bot restarts multiple times
- Historical data is preserved and can be analyzed
- Most active hour detection works reliably
- Performance is optimized by using database queries

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding weekly and monthly statistics views
- Add channel-specific statistics breakdown
- Implement message type tracking (text, image, links, etc.)
- Add growth trend visualization
